# 🚨 ISCXIDS2012 - Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

A comprehensive project that benchmarks multiple ML models to detect network intrusions using the ISCXIDS2012 dataset. The system processes day-wise traffic data and evaluates models like Random Forest, SVM, ExtraTrees, Gradient Boost, and more. The pipeline is fully automated and generates performance metrics for all models on all days.

Technologies Used 
* Python 3.x
* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib` (for optional plotting)
* Dataset: [ISCXIDS2012](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html)

## Setup Instruction
1\. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhyeyinf/ShieldNet.git
cd ShieldNet
```
2\. Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed (≥3.7), then:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can manually install:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains six days of network traffic:
| `-D` | Day       | Filename                 | Attack Scenario                 |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0    | Monday    | TestbedMonJun14Flows.csv | HTTP DoS (Hulk)                 |
| 1    | Tuesday   | TestbedTueJun15Flows.csv | DDoS via IRC Botnet             |
| 2    | Wednesday | TestbedWedJun16Flows.csv | Brute Force                     |
| 3    | Thursday  | TestbedThuJun17Flows.csv | SSH Brute Force                 |
| 4    | Saturday  | TestbedSatJun19Flows.csv | Additional Brute Force Variants |
| 5    | Sunday    | TestbedSunJun20Flows.csv | Infiltration Attack             |

Each file is split into 70% training and 30% testing data during preprocessing.

### How to Run
1\. Run All Models on All Days
From the project root:
```bash
chmod +x runner-scripts/run_all_models.sh
./runner-scripts/run_all_models.sh
```
This will: 
* Run every ML model on all 6 days.
* Save JSON results in `results/single/<model_name>/`

2\. Extract Metrics into CSV
```bash
python extract_all_metrics.py
```
This will generate a consolidated CSV report with:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC AUC
- Runtime
- Day (-D)
- Model name
## Available Models
The following models are evaluated in the project:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (`knn`)
- Nearest Centroid (`ncentroid`)
- Decision Tree (`dtree`)
- Linear SVM (`linsvc`)
- RBF SVM (`rbfsvc`)
- Random Forest (`rforest`)
- AdaBoost (`ada`)
- Bagging (`bag`)
- Logistic Regression (binlr)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(`qda`)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis(`lda`)
- XGBoost (`xgboost`)
- Gradient Boost (`gradboost`)
- Extremely Randomised Trees (`extratree`)

Each model can also be run individually using:
```bash
python ml.py -D 0 -F rforest
```

Change `-D` to target day and `-F` to the model short-name.

## Plotting (Optional)
If needed later:
```bash
python plotting/plot_single_metrics.py -D 0 -F rforest
```
### Sample Output
After running, the results will be visible in:
```bash
results/single/<model_name>/<day>_<model>_Z_<%.json>
```
And the extracted final CSV report will summarize everything.
